# Journal for Discover-Art

## Day 1
Today was spent validating some of the ideas I will be using to cluster, discover and recommend art for Drizl. The day was mainly focused on starting to build up the pipeline needed to get features for artwork. I explored different packages which can retrieve image characterists (PIL, skimage, misc, openCV, color, colorthief...). Some of the features I'd like to build are: color palette, color temperature, blurriness, symmetry, complexity. 

- #### **Tasks Accomplished:**
  - started build of Art() class
    - `extract_RGB`
    - `extract_blurriness`
    - `get_palette`
  - downloaded Drizl Corpus locally
  - explored how to calculate symmetry
